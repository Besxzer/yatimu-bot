    ### How to play name-a-pic
    
    1. create a game with `/nic create`
    2. join the game with `/nic join`
    3. start the game with `/nic start` (who /nic create use this command only)
    4. the user who creates the game (call giver) selects your favorite picture and sends it to your discord text channel
    5. another user (call namer) uses `/nic send [name]` ([name] that you can name the picture which giver send from 4.)
    6. giver votes favorite name by **emote number**

    8. finally, you can end the game by giver use `/nic end`
